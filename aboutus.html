    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Farmers Market is an online platform where buyers and sellers meet to trade farm produce.</p>
    <p>Itâ€™s accessible through the internet and allows farmers to post free ads of their farm produce for potential customers.</p>
    <p>We aim to promote clean-living and clean consumer products, by bridging the gap between the consumers and the farmers.</p>
